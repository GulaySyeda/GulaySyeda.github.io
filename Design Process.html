            <p>Design processes are non linear because there will almost always be a need to back a step for improvement or to fill gaps in the previous stages. In class we discussed 5 steps of design.<br>Namely:</p>
            <ul>    
                <li>Discover,</li>
                <li>Define,</li>
                <li>Design,</li>
                <li>Develop,</li>
                <li>and Deliver</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Discover and define phases consist of research and making sense of this research. In my opinion, these stages are the most important as they mould the whole process and back the design and the overall project. Especially in the Inclusive Design perscpetive, this is where designers and researchers understand context, issues, backgrounds, communities, systems, etc. in a lot of depth and start the co-design process to understand how the community would like the design of the final solution to be. This is where the design squiggle makes sense. Concept is created after the discovery stage and in the define stage.</p>
            <p>The ideation phase, called the design phase comes next. A lot of designers go back and forth to the research and define phase. </p>

            <p class="section-headings">EXPLORING DIVERSE IDEAS</p>
                <p>Identify three cases where neglecting users and communities through the design and decision making process resulted in a product, space, system, service, policy or situation of exclusion.</p>

                Lack of Financial Literacy</p>

            <p>People being excluded include those who do not have access to accurate financial information. The idea I propose is to avoid financial jargons when designing financial applications and/or systems. Secondly, to create accessible repositories containing information on basic financial skills updated responsibly.  
            <br><br><strong>What is financial Literacy?</strong> The ability to understand + effectively use financial skills - budgeting, investing, saving, credit and financial management, etc. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-literacy.asp#:~:text=Financial%20literacy%20is%20the%20ability,a%20lifelong%20journey%20of%20learning.">(source)</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>the inability to manage money</li>
                <li>enabling poverty + hampering prosperity</li>
                <li>potential cause for under saving</li>
                <li>common among low-income individuals because they typically do not have access to accurate financial information</li>
                <li>youth in low-income households can fall victim later as adults to scams, high interest loans and increasing debts</li>
            </ul>

                Underground Stations in Toronto, Canada</p>
               
            <img class= "presentation" src="https://gulaysjournal.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/group-52.png?w=1024">
            <p>People being excluded include those who use a wheelchair/ walker or children's trams in their daily lives.
            <br>
            <br>The idea I propose to make all underground stations accessible rather than a few by installing elevators. 
            <br>There are 3 King Station underground station entrances and none of them are wheelchair accessible. The nearest one would be at Queen which adds an extra 7 minutes to the trip while the Google Maps app reads that the map might not reflect actual scenarios.
            <br>
            <p>Extra Notes</p>  
            <li>All the above ground trains are extremely inaccessible as they are all located on the outskirts of the city. <br>The way it is structured, citizens who do not have a car and want to travel away from downtown will need to make a long trip.</li>

                Food Apps in Pakistan</p>
               
            <img class= "presentation" src="https://gulaysjournal.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/group-53.png?w=1024">
            <p>People being excluded include those who have physical permanent disabilities such as visual, hearing and mobility or dexterity impairments.

                The idea I propose is to create an interface which ask the users which accessibility settings they require at the process of onboarding - this means designing a different user path for each type of user
    
                Food apps in Pakistan are limited in terms of accessibility. There are users with disabilities and almost no app has taken that into consideration.
    
                *These disabilities can be permanent, temporary or situational)
    
                Based on personal research, app creators and designers in Pakistan rely on device accessibility settings for users with disabilities without consciously creating an accessible design that is compatible with assistive technology.
