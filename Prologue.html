            WHAT IS CRITICAL THINKING & INCLUSIVE DESIGN?
        </p>
        <p class="introduction">
        <strong>What is Critical thinking?</strong><br>
        <strong>What is Inclusive Design?</strong> 'A methodology, born out of digital environments, that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives.'<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/"> Microsoft</a>
        <br>Process as opposed to a result. Your work as, an Inclusive Designer, is never complete. There will always be someone who will be exlcluded.
        <br> What does it lead to?
        <br>Deep dive into yourself and find your biases - why do I have these biases? <br>How can I recognize them in order to make an effort to reduce or limit them from clouding my judgement and thinking critically?
