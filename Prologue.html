                WHAT IS CRITICAL THINKING & INCLUSIVE DESIGN?
            </p>  
                <p class="introduction">

                    <strong>What is Inclusive Design?</strong> 'A methodology, born out of digital environments, that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives.'<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/"> <strong>Microsoft</strong></a>

                    <br>This methodology creates a process as opposed to a result. The task, as an Inclusive Designer, is never really complete - (perfection never exists) A design can never include everyone. Are we, then, supposed to make a different product entirely, every time there is a different type of user? Do we need to create a design that includes everyone or is it already understandable that it cannot be done? That we should make variations? Microsoft came up with all these new gadgets but are they really accessible to the wide majority of people i.e. disabled users, who were intended to use them? Nevertheless, this creates an opportunity of constant learning and interacting with people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. 
                    
                    <br>(People all their lives look for ways to fit into the crowd somehow. (Looking for the average man) Are we making them part of the average? Or are we celebrating these differences and highlighting their differences? What is better? Do they want to stand out of the crowd? It depends on the situation they are in.)
                    
                    <br>What can we say about these designs? Critical Thinking can lead to bias. One creates an understanding based on their experiences and their work. It shapes their meaning making of the world.
                    
                    <br>How can we eliminate these biases? We cannot have them if our purpose is to eliminate exclusion which biases tend to create. Deep dive into yourself and find your biases to eliminate them or maybe just reflect on them. Create a mirror to yourself - of your world.

                    <p class="introduction">
                        <strong>3 Dimensions of Inclusive Design Frameworks</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recognize, respect, and design for human uniqueness and variability,</li>
                        <li>Use inclusive, open & transparent processes,</li>
                        <li>Realize that you are designing in a <strong><em>complex adaptive system.</em></li></strong>
                    </ul>
                    <p><em>— Jutta Treviranus, The Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC)</em></p>
                    Designing for a complex adaptive system means that the issue I maybe tackling lies within multiple layers - some hidden but nevertheless present.
