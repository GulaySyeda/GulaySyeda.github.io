                <p>What is a persona spectrum and how does it help us? This map includes how we look at profiles of users we are designing for but does it encompass everyone? What does it lack? We are generalizing the process and including representatives for designing the solution.
                User groups can be used in place of using user profiles or personas. It can include four or more people in a group who share similar interests and are looking for similar outcomes.</p>
                <ul>    
                    <li>How should we decide who our sample should be when conducting research?</li>
                    <li>As everyone's persepective is different, in a time sensitive project, how should we go about collecting representatives for our study?</li>
                    <li>High risk and Low Risk</li><p>Trial and error</p>
                    <li>Inclusive Design Spiral - we are always going to go back to nature</li><p>However, we keep on evolving and we have evolved since then. Which means even though we go back to our roots and study how things used to be, we take the learnings and use it based on our evolution.</p>
                    <li>Go beyond and see what is happening!</li>

                <p>Be open to change and to look at things in a different perspetive than your own. Sometimes you will need to "bring in the cook" to make the solution work i.e. bring in a expert who knows that discipline for co-design. As every discipline has their own language and sometimes you might not understand it.
                    The Inclusive Design process is one that includes everyone, and this also includes those who are already in the field researching and designing for that specific purpose. <br> The question is how do we make them think inclusively if they do not think on those terms? If there is a situation when they are the experts but the end decision is taken by you. Does that work?
                Can the cook only advice and then take the back seat while the others fish? The cook might not know how to fish other than cooking it and making it delicious.</p>
